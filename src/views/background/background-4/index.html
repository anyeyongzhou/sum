        The only survivor couldn't tell us why the zimtrum sank. It seems that
        the speed of the ship's sinking is very fast. This theory can be
        supported by a lot of debris. However, the specific cause of the
        cracking could not be determined. No drastic weather changes were
        reported in the radio navigation signal area that day. Survivors'
        estimates of the weather based on their impressions are unreliable.
        Weather was at best one of the factors that led to the sinking of the
        ship. The reason may be inside the ship. The explosion of the boiler may
        be serious, but the survivors believe that there is a mechanical
        explosion. The ship has lived for 29 years (made in 1948 at erlanson and
        skank shipyards in Malmo) and was renovated in 1970. Bad weather and
        fatigue of the ship's structure may have contributed to the accident,
        but this is only speculation. There were no reports of accidents with
        other vessels in that area that day, so there was no possibility of
        collision with other vessels. There is a possibility of collision with
        the wreckage, but this cannot be confirmed. The only survivor couldn't
        tell us why the zimtrum sank. It seems that the speed of the ship's
        sinking is very fast. This theory can be supported by a lot of debris.
